            <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last updated: July 22, 2025</p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>By downloading, installing, accessing, or using StepGuard ("the App," "our App," or "the Service"), you ("User," "you," or "your") agree to be legally bound by these Terms & Conditions ("Terms," "Agreement"). These Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you and StepGuard. If you do not agree to all of these Terms, you must not download, install, access, or use the App. Your continued use of the App constitutes your ongoing acceptance of these Terms and any modifications we may make to them.</p>

            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>StepGuard is a privacy-focused mobile application designed to promote healthy digital habits through step-based device restrictions. The App operates entirely on your local device and provides the following core functionalities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Step-Based Access Control:</strong> Links your daily physical activity (measured in steps) to your ability to access specified applications and websites, encouraging a balance between digital engagement and physical wellness.</li>
                <li><strong>Customizable Restriction Profiles:</strong> Allows you to set personalized step goals and choose which apps or websites should be restricted until those goals are achieved.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Progress Tracking:</strong> Displays your current step count and progress toward daily goals, with all data processing occurring locally on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Restriction Management:</strong> Automatically enables or disables access to restricted content based on whether you have met your daily step targets.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy-First Architecture:</strong> Operates without collecting, storing, or transmitting any of your personal data to external servers or third parties.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Data Access and Privacy Commitment</h2>
            <p>StepGuard requires access to specific device functions to operate effectively, but we are committed to protecting your privacy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect, store, process, or transmit any of your personal information, health data, usage patterns, or any other data to our servers or any third-party services. All data remains exclusively on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Required Device Access:</strong> The App requests permission to access your step count data (through Apple Health or device sensors), monitor app usage for restriction enforcement, and control screen time features. This access is essential for the App's core functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> All calculations, goal tracking, and restriction logic occur entirely on your device using your device's processing power and storage.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Data Protection:</strong> Your step count and activity data are accessed only when needed for real-time functionality and are never stored permanently by our App.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Our privacy practices can be verified through your device's privacy and permission settings, and we encourage users to review these regularly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. User Responsibilities and Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>By using StepGuard, you agree to the following responsibilities and restrictions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Restriction Compliance:</strong> You agree not to circumvent, bypass, or attempt to disable the App's restrictions through technical means, third-party software, or manipulation of system settings while the App is active.</li>
                <li><strong>Lawful Use:</strong> You will use the App only for lawful purposes and in compliance with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Security:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device, including protecting it from unauthorized access that might compromise the App's restriction mechanisms.</li>
                <li><strong>Accurate Information:</strong> You agree to provide accurate step goals and app/website selections that reflect your genuine intentions for digital wellness.</li>
                <li><strong>Age Requirements:</strong> You confirm that you are at least 13 years of age, or have parental consent if younger, and have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement.</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> You acknowledge that the App's restrictions should not be relied upon in emergency situations, and you maintain responsibility for ensuring access to emergency services and contacts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Device Restrictions and Functionality</h2>
            <p>Understanding how StepGuard's restrictions work is essential for safe and effective use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Restriction Scope:</strong> The App may limit or prevent access to applications, websites, or device functions that you have specifically selected for restriction, based on whether you have achieved your daily step goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Goal-Based Access:</strong> Access to restricted content is automatically restored when you reach your predetermined step count targets, as measured by your device's health and fitness systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency Override:</strong> While the App is designed to encourage healthy habits, it should never be used in ways that could prevent access to emergency services, critical communications, or essential functions during urgent situations.</li>
                <li><strong>System Integration:</strong> The App integrates with your device's built-in screen time, app restrictions, and content filtering systems to implement its functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Customization Control:</strong> You maintain full control over which apps and websites are subject to restrictions and can modify these settings at any time through the App interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Reset and Override Options:</strong> The App provides mechanisms for you to reset daily goals or temporarily override restrictions when necessary, though frequent use of these features may diminish the App's effectiveness.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. Health and Wellness Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>StepGuard is designed to promote digital wellness but has important limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Not Medical Advice:</strong> The App is not intended to provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Step count goals and recommendations are for general wellness purposes only and should not replace professional medical guidance.</li>
                <li><strong>Individual Health Considerations:</strong> Users with health conditions, mobility limitations, or other physical constraints should consult healthcare providers before setting step goals or using the App's restriction features.</li>
                <li><strong>Accuracy Limitations:</strong> Step counting accuracy may vary based on device sensors, carrying position, and individual movement patterns. The App relies on your device's health systems for step data and cannot guarantee perfect accuracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral Tool Only:</strong> StepGuard is a tool to support healthy digital habits but cannot address underlying behavioral issues, addiction, or mental health concerns that may require professional intervention.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            <p>StepGuard and its associated intellectual property are protected by applicable laws:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>App Ownership:</strong> The StepGuard application, including its design, code, algorithms, user interface, and documentation, is owned by StepGuard and protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.</li>
                <li><strong>Limited License:</strong> We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App solely for personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with these Terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Restrictions on Use:</strong> You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease, reverse engineer, decompile, or create derivative works based on the App or any portion thereof.</li>
                <li><strong>Trademark Rights:</strong> "StepGuard" and associated logos are trademarks of StepGuard and may not be used without explicit written permission.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Disclaimers and Warranties</h2>
            <p>StepGuard is provided with the following important disclaimers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>As-Is Provision:</strong> The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</li>
                <li><strong>No Guarantee of Availability:</strong> We do not guarantee that the App will be continuously available, error-free, or free from interruptions, bugs, or technical issues.</li>

                <li><strong>Third-Party Integration:</strong> The App's functionality depends on integration with your device's health systems and restriction mechanisms, which are controlled by your device's operating system and may change without notice.</li>
                <li><strong>Effectiveness Disclaimer:</strong> We do not guarantee that using StepGuard will achieve specific health, fitness, or behavioral outcomes, as individual results may vary significantly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>Your use of StepGuard is subject to the following liability limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consequential Damages:</strong> In no event shall StepGuard, its developers, affiliates, or partners be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the App.</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum Liability:</strong> Our total liability for any claims related to the App shall not exceed the amount you paid for the App, or if the App was free, then our liability shall be limited to $10 USD.</li>
                <li><strong>Health and Safety:</strong> We are not liable for any health issues, injuries, or safety concerns that may arise from following the App's step goals or restrictions. Users assume full responsibility for their physical safety and health decisions.</li>

            <h2>10. Account and Service Termination</h2>
            <p>These Terms govern the termination of your use of StepGuard:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User-Initiated Termination:</strong> You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your device. Since we do not collect or store your data, uninstallation completely removes all App-related information from our systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Termination for Cause:</strong> We reserve the right to restrict access to future App updates or support if we determine that you have violated these Terms, though we cannot remotely disable the App once installed.</li>
                <li><strong>No Account Dependencies:</strong> Since StepGuard operates without user accounts or cloud services, termination does not affect data stored on your device or require account deletion procedures.</li>
                <li><strong>Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon termination, your license to use the App ends, but data stored locally on your device remains under your control.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Permission Requirements:</strong> Full functionality requires granting permissions for health data access, app usage monitoring, and screen time controls through your device's system settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery and Performance:</strong> The App is designed to minimize battery usage and performance impact, but some effect on device performance may occur during active restriction monitoring.</li>
                <li><strong>Compatibility Changes:</strong> Operating system updates may affect App functionality, and we strive to maintain compatibility but cannot guarantee immediate updates for all system changes.</li>
